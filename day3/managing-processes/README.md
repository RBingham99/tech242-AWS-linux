## Managing processes

# 2 types of processes
- System processes
- User processes

# Viewing processes
There are multiple ways to view processes, you can:
- You can use `ps` to view user processes
- You can use `ps -A` or `ps -e` to view all processes
- You can do `ps aux` to view all processes with extra detail
- You can use `top` to show the processes using the most cpu power by default, but you can press `shift + m` to change to the processes using the most memory.

# When you view processes 
- You will see the PID for each process, the PID is the process ID.
- You will see the TTY for each process, the TTY relates to the terminal that the process is related to.
